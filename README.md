It's a studying project. Goal of project - is implementation of [mal language](https://github.com/kanaka/mal).

I decided to stop coding it. The reason is I don't use tests from main repository, and now in stepA (self-hosting) it is hard to debug it. I learned a lot, but I understand that **really** wants to write interpreter, so I started it anew in [my fork of mal](https://github.com/davemus/mal).
