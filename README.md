It's a studying project. Goal of project - is implementation of [mal language](https://github.com/kanaka/mal).

I restarted project and, finally, finished it. You can find history of my implementation in my [fork of
mal](https://github.com/davemus/mal). Here is only final files.

My variant of mal completes (as of 2021-05-04) all main tests and optional except:

* 3 optional tests in stepA
* all optional tests, related to quasiquote special form, that is needed only for debug

You could run it via ```python3 stepA.py```

For syntax please refer to [original repository docs](https://github.com/kanaka/mal/tree/master/docs)
